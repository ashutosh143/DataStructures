 *
 * The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array,
 * find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days.
 * For example, if the given array is {2,4,6,8,5,3,1,3,7} the maximum profit can be earned by buying on day 0, 
 * selling on day 3. Again buy on day 6 and sell on day 8. 
 * If the given array of prices is sorted in decreasing order, 
 * then profit cannot be earned at all.
